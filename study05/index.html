              A number of infectious diseases can be spread from one person to
              another by contaminated hands. These diseases include
              gastrointestinal infections, such as Salmonella, and respiratory
              infections, such as influenza. Washing your hands properly can
              help prevent the spread of the germs (like bacteria and viruses)
              that cause these diseases. Some forms of gastrointestinal and
              respiratory infections can cause serious complications, especially
              for young children, the elderly, or those with a weakened immune
              system.

          <h2>How?</h2>
          <div class="p--wrap how">
            <p>To wash hands properly:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Wet your hands with clean, running water, turn off the tap.
              </li>
              <li>
                Apply soap and lather well for 20 seconds (or longer if the dirt
                is ingrained).
              </li>
              <li>
                Rub hands together rapidly across all surfaces of your hands and
                wrists.
              </li>
              <li>
                Donâ€™t forget the backs of your hands, your wrists, between your
                fingers and under your fingernails.
              </li>
              <li>
                If possible, remove rings and watches before you wash your
                hands, or ensure you move the rings to wash under them, as
                microorganisms can exist under them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rinse well under running water and make sure all traces of soap
                are removed.
              </li>
              <li>Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them</li>
              <li>
                It is best to use paper towels (or single-use cloth towel).
              </li>
              <li>
                Dry under any rings, as they can be a source of future
                contamination if they remain moist.
              </li>
              <li>Hot air driers can be used.</li>
